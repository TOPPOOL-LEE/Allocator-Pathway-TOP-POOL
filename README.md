# Filecoin Plus DataCap Allocator - Client Applications

Welcome to the TOP-POOL Allocator GitHub repository dedicated to managing the Lifecycle Data Notations (LDN) Applications for a specific Filecoin Plus DataCap allocator team. This repository serves as a public ledger for DataCap allocation requests and tracking, facilitating transparency and efficiency in the process.


## Allocator-Pathway-TOP-POOL
TOPPOOL is a resource optimization platform dedicated to connecting the blockchain and metaverse industries. We joined the Filecoin network in 2019, 2022, we established a FIL+-based technical department with the goal of bringing green, valuable, and efficient data storage to the Filecoin network.

## Overview
The DataCap allocator provided by TOPPOOL offers comprehensive, unique, diversified, and traceable paths:

Comprehensive due diligence: Our due diligence process includes customer submission of application forms, contract signing, collaboration with third-party KYB companies, and, if the customer is in the same country as us, on-site visits to the customer's company. Comprehensive due diligence is a prerequisite for customers to obtain DC.

Diversified DataCap options: We provide various DataCap options, allowing enterprise-level customers, customers with public datasets, and individuals with substantial data to submit applications to us.

Transparency and traceability: We create a TOPPOOL GitHub project group where customers can submit their applications. Both we and the community can monitor customer usage at any time, ensuring high transparency and traceability.

## DataCap Allocation Strategy

Data backup (number of SPs): 5-8

First Allocation: ≤256 TiB
Second Allocation:≤512 TiB
Third Allocation：≤1024 TiB
Fourth Allocation：≤2048 TiB
Fifth Allocation：≤2048 TiB
The Max Allocation Cant’t Exceed 2048 TiB

## The geographic or regional distribution 
We require SP distribution across two different continents, with no single SP exceeding a 25% share. Regarding regions, all areas are considered equal. 
Supported regions include Greater China, Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.


## Risk Mitigation, Auditing, Compliance

Our DataCap allocation dispute resolution process focuses on timely response, transparency, and establishing effective accountability mechanisms. This ensures that disputes are resolved fairly, objectively, and effectively, while maintaining trust and cooperative relationships.

Response Time: We prioritize timely handling of disputes. Once notified of a DataCap allocation dispute, we will initiate the resolution process as soon as possible. We aim to follow up and address the dispute within 24 hours. We will gather all relevant information and documents related to the DataCap allocation dispute, including DataCap allocation records, communication logs, agreements, contracts, evidence, etc. We will carefully analyze this information and conduct an objective and comprehensive assessment to understand all aspects and underlying causes of the dispute.

Transparency: We are committed to maintaining a high level of transparency. When handling DataCap allocation disputes, we actively engage with all parties involved and provide detailed explanations and information. We encourage the use of channels such as GitHub, Slack public channels, and Zoom meetings as central platforms for resolving disputes. This ensures that all decisions, discussions, and outcomes are documented.

Accountability Mechanisms: We have established clear accountability mechanisms to ensure proper handling of DataCap allocation disputes. If any party is found to have been at fault, their DC quota will be reduced.
