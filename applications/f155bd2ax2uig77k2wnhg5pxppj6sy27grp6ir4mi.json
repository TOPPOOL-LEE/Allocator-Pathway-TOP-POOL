    "Brief history of your project and organization": "https://registry.opendata.aws/aiwp/：222.78 TiB\nThis is an archive of pure AI-based weather prediction reforecasts produced collaboratively between the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) and the NOAA Global Systems Laboratory (NOAA-GSL).\n\n\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/ont-open-data/ 140.66 TB\nThe ont-open-data registry provides reference sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to support, 1) Exploration of the characteristics of nanopore sequence data. 2) Assessment and reproduction of performance benchmarks 3) Development of tools and methods. The data deposited showcases DNA sequences from a representative subset of sequencing chemistries. The datasets correspond to publicly-available reference samples (e.g. Genome In A Bottle reference cell lines). Raw data are provided with metadata and scripts to describe sample and data provenance.\n\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/terrafusion/ 136.23 TB\nThe Terra Basic Fusion dataset is a fused dataset of the original Level 1 radiances from the five Terra instruments. They have been fully validate to contain the original Terra instrument Level 1 data. Each Level 1 Terra Basic Fusion file contains one full Terra orbit of data and is typically 15 – 40 GB in size, depending on how much data was collected for that orbit. It contains instrument radiance in physical units; radiance quality indicator; geolocation for each IFOV at its native resolution; sun-view geometry; bservation time; and other attributes/metadata.\n\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-wave-ensemble-reforecast/ 114.29 TB\nThis is a 20-year global wave reforecast generated by WAVEWATCH III model (https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3) forced by GEFSv12 winds (https://noaa-gefs-retrospective.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The wave ensemble was run with one cycle per day (at 03Z), spatial resolution of 0.25°X0.25° and temporal resolution of 3 hours. There are five ensemble members (control plus four perturbed members) and, once a week (Wednesdays), the ensemble is expanded to eleven members. The forecast range is 16 days and, once a week (Wednesdays), it extends to 35 days.\n\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/wbg-cckp/ 112.58 TB\n\nCCKP provides open access to a comprehensive suite of climate and climate change resources derived from the latest generation of climate data archives. Products are based on a consistent and transparent approach with a systematic way of pre-processing the raw observed and model-based projection data to enable inter-comparable use across a broad range of applications. Climate products consist of basic climate variables as well as a large collection (70+) of more specialized, application-orientated variables and indices across different scenarios. Precomputed data can be extracted per specified variables, select timeframes, climate projection scenarios, across ensembles or individual models, etc\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/elp-nouabale-landscape/ 108.26 TB\nArchival soundscapes recorded in the rainforest landscapes of Central Africa, with a focus on the vocalizations of African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis).\n\n\nhttps://registry.opendata.aws/paracrawl/ 97.83 TB\nParaCrawl is a set of large parallel corpora to/from English for all official EU languages by a broad web crawling effort. State-of-the-art methods are applied for the entire processing chain from identifying web sites with translated text all the way to collecting, cleaning and delivering parallel corpora that are ready as training data for CEF.AT and translation memories for DG Translation.",
