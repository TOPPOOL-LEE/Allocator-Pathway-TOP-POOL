    "Brief history of your project and organization": "This is an archive of pure AI-based weather prediction reforecasts produced collaboratively between the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) and the NOAA Global Systems Laboratory (NOAA-GSL).\n\nCurrently, FourCastNetv2-small, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast are included, with more models to come. Each of these models has been initialized with both NOAA GFS (directories with no extension) and ECMWF IFS initial conditions (directories ending in \"_IFS\"). The datasets are updated with near-real-time data twice per day (00Z and 12Z initializations).",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
