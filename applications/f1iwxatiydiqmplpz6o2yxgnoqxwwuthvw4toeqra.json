    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, that culminated in this publicly available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses, across all climate regions in the United States. These EULPs were created by calibrating the ResStock and ComStock physics-based building stock models using many different measured datasets, as described here. This dataset includes load profiles for both the baseline building stock and the building stock with various energy efficiency, electrification, and demand flexibility upgrades applied.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, that culminated in this publicly available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses, across all climate regions in the United States.

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We developed our own platform using tools developed by Venus. In terms of data retrieval, the feature is to use scripts to traverse and execute. In terms of data download, we download the data according to the AWS command line. After downloading, we use the open source go-graphsplit of the fileddrive-team to cut it into small files of a specified size. The csv file will store the piece_cid and size information corresponding to the source file.\n",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Resources on AWS\nDescription\nEnd-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::oedi-data-lake/nrel-pds-building-stock/\nAWS Region\nus-west-2\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://oedi-data-lake/nrel-pds-building-stock/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03540144 Philippines\nf03540147 Philippines\nf03540153 Singapore\nf03601955 Singapore\nf03601967 South Korea\nf03601993 South Korea\nf03298672 Germany\nf03298673 Germany\nf03308920 United Kingdom",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
