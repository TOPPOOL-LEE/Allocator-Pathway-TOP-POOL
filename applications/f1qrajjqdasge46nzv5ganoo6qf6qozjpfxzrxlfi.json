    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Sup3rCC is downscaled Global Climate Model (GCM) data. For example, the initial file set tagged \"sup3rcc_conus_mriesm20_ssp585_r1i1p1f1\" is downscaled from MRI ESM 2.0 for climate change scenario SSP5 8.5 and variant label r1i1p1f1. The downscaling process is performed using a generative machine learning approach called sup3r: Super-Resolution for Renewable Energy Resource Data. The data includes both historical and future weather years, although the historical years represent the historical average climate, not true historical weather. The Sup3rCC data is intended to help researchers study the impact of climate change on energy systems with high levels of wind and solar power generation. Please note that all climate change data is only a representation of the possible future climate and contains significant uncertainty. Analysis of multiple climate change scenarios and multiple climate models can help quantify this uncertainty.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "Yes",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=nrel-pds-sup3rcc",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Shipping hard drives, HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02827953 \nf02827843 \nf02827109 \nf02826602 \nf02825675",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
