    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Geosnap Data contains several datasets (as Quilt packages) created by the Center for Geospatial Sciences (CGS) at the University of California, Riverside. The data in this bucket includes the following:\n\nTabular and geographic data from the U.S. Census\nLand cover imagery collected by the Multiresolution Land Features Consortium\nRoad network data processed from OpenStreetMap",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Geosnap Data contains several datasets (as Quilt packages) created by the Center for Geospatial Sciences (CGS) at the University of California, Riverside. The data in this bucket includes the following:\n\nTabular and geographic data from the U.S. Census\nLand cover imagery collected by the Multiresolution Land Features Consortium\nRoad network data processed from OpenStreetMap",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We use Python and other tools to collect and organize data, and we build upon that foundation. We utilize the Pandas library in Python to ensure that the data has no duplicates and to handle missing values or outliers. Then, we segment the data and convert it into a format supported by Filecoin.\n",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "Data files are stored in a public bucket in Apache Parquet and GeoTiff formats\nResource type\nS3 bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::spatial-ucr\nAWS region\nus-east-1\nAWS CLI access (no AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://spatial-ucr/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, North America, Europe, South America, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, IPFS, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02865213 United States\nf02887063 United States\nf02927642 Vietnam\nf02953218 Russia\nSince you only signed 256T for us and then suspended it, after you resumed it for us, these SPs no longer cooperated with us, so we found other SPs.\n\nf02869125 France\nf02916974 United States\nf02952530 Thailand\nf03233356 South Korea\nf03358608 HK\nf03493287 HK\nf03312989 HK\nf03253403 HK\nf014686  US\nf014699  US\n\nWe will update once the new SP is confirmed.",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
