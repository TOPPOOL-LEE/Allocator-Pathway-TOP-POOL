    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Download the corresponding data set\nUse the boost tool to calculate the corresponding data set into car files.\nStore the car file in the specified storage\nDiscuss with SP how much data to store and which data to store. SP downloads or copies in advance.\nSend the corresponding data deals to SP to complete the data transaction on the Filecoin chain.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline/stages-of-jwst-data-processing#gsc.tab=0\nhttps://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/data_products/product_types.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_DMNFXVB5s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVRmjXlUk6s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuQC8Ky3Sz4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_DMNFXVB5s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUa2zBU6SgI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvuoTBO8Ko0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8wkneaZ13c",
