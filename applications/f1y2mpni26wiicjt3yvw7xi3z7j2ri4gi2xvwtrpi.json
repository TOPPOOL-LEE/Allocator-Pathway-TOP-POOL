    "Brief history of your project and organization": "we are the development team, more than 90% of which are developers, more than half of whom have more than 5 years of development experience in communication, Internet, blockchain and other industries. We hope that we can gain users' recognition by exporting useful tools and platforms.\r\n",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Disclaimer: \r\nDue to un-answered issues around whether combined requests or duplicate requests can be used to apply LDN. This is a series of recent new open datasets never applied by anybody (aka calling dibs).\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nThe Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the Cell Painting assay. The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. \r\n\r\ns3://cellpainting-gallery",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "After we download data from the Internet, the data is cut into disks through Singularity, and then the hard disk is mailed to the SPs.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f02984331 --Australia \r\nf02883857 -- Singapore \r\nf02852273 -- United Kingdom \r\nf02973061 -- Russia\r\nf02889193---Vietnam",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
