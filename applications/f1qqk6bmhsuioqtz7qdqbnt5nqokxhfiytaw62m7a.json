    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project has a singular mission: to accelerate ice sheet and glacier research by producing globally comprehensive, high resolution, low latency, temporally dense, multi-sensor records of land ice and ice shelf change while minimizing barriers between the data and the user. ITS_LIVE data currently consists of NetCDF Level 2 scene-pair ice flow products posted to a standard 120 m grid derived from Landsat 4/5/7/8/9, Sentinel-2 optical scenes, and Sentinel-1 SAR scenes. We have processed all land-ice intersecting image pairs separated by ≤546 days for optical and ≤12 for SAR sensors, for all missions from each mission start to the end of 2022. The ITS_LIVE project will continue processing new optical and radar scene pairs as they come in, and will soon increase production to include SAR image pairs separated by more than 12 days. We also expect to extend processing to include ASTER, RADARSAT, and NISAR imagery. Further, all scene pair data are combined into a set of Zarr datacubes that are cloud-optimized for time-series analysis, with a suite of user tools available to query the data effectively. The ITS_LIVE project is also producing a suite of Level 3 products, including quarterly and annual ice-sheet and regional velocity mosaics as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, standardized records of elevation change rates for Greenland and Antarctica, and ice shelf and tidewater glacier front positions.",
